# XeoEngine

XeoEngine is a 3D engine on WebGL that aims to provide lots of power and flexibility within a comprehensive *object-component-based* API.

This engine is based on lessons learned from the development and application of [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org).

It's currently at **alpha** status, where in order to get the design right, the documentation is released for peer review *before* the implementation.

## Features 

 - [Solid API documentation](http://xeoengine.org/docs/index.html)
 - [Object-component based architecture](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html)
 - [Defaults for *everything*](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html)
 - [Shader-based effects pipelines](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Shader.html)
 - [Save and load engine state to and from JSON](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html#savingAndLoadingJSON)
 - Automatic lost WebGL context recovery
 - Optimized performance using draw list caching, state sorting etc.
