# XEO Engine

XEO Engine is a 3D engine on WebGL that aims to provide lots of power and flexibility within a simple component-based API.

This engine is based on lessons learned from the development and application of [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org).

It's currently at **alpha** status, where the documentation is provided for peer review *before* the implementation is released.

## Features 

 - [Solid API documentation](http://xeoengine.org/docs/index.html)
 - Simple object-component based architecture](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html)
 - Sensible defaults for *everything*](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html)
 - Shader-based effects pipelines](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Shader.html)
 - [Save and load scene state to/from JSON](http://xeoengine.org/docs/classes/Scene.html#savingAndLoadingJSON)
